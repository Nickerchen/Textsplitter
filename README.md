# Textsplitter

Tool developed to quickly split books so i can upload them to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) and use the Text to Speech feature which is limited to 24,200 words

The most convenient way I have found to use it is like this:

- Clone this repo
- add the txt file you want to use into this folder
- split the file with the python script like this:
```
$ python textsplitter.py <filename>
```
- commit all the files and upload them to a private repository
- add the files to your pocket account from your online repository

I am happy about feedback and feature requests :)

Happy listening
